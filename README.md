# Singly-Linked-List
This repository contains a robust implementation of a singly linked list data structure in C++. A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, points to the next node, forming a sequence.

Features
---

Insertion:
At the beginning of the list
At the end of the list
After a specified node

Deletion:
From the beginning of the list
From the end of the list
Specific nodes by value

Search:
Find a node by value
Find the prior node of a specified node

Usage
---
The implementation is encapsulated in a class ll with methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying the list. It is designed to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental operations on a singly linked list and can be easily integrated into other projects.
